    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <section id="our-mission">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We dream of a world where butterflies flourish within their native ecosystems, 
            enriching biodiversity and ensuring the vitality of our natural landscapes across the United States. 
            Our vision is for a future where the activities of humans seamlessly integrate with the natural world, 
            nurturing the existence of these essential pollinators. Our mission is to enlighten and advocate for butterfly 
            conservation, offering in-depth resources and captivating materials that underscore the critical ecological 
            roles butterflies play, from pollination to signaling the health of our environment. Our goal is to motivate both 
            individuals and communities to engage in significant efforts that bolster the populations of these indispensable 
            insects.</p>

    <!-- Why Butterflies Matter -->
    <section id="why-butterflies-matter">
        <h2>Why Butterflies Matter</h2>
        <p>Butterflies are facing new challenges, with many species experiencing significant declines due to habitat loss, 
            climate change, and other human-induced factors. Species like the Monarch and the Miami Blue are symbolic of the 
            broader threats to biodiversity and the urgent need for organized and concerted conservation efforts. Our mission 
            matters because it represents a proactive step toward reversing these declines, ensuring that butterflies continue 
            to play their critical roles in pollination and serving as key indicators of environmental health. By fostering a 
            community committed to conservation, education, and advocacy, we can create a collective impact that protects 
            butterflies and, by extension, the ecosystems they inhabit.</p>

    <!-- Butterflies at Risk -->
    <section id="get-involved">
        <h2>Are Butterflies at Risk?</h2>
        <p>Some butterfly species are indeed considered endangered or at risk, facing threats from habitat loss, 
            climate change, pollution, and the use of pesticides. The exact status can vary widely among species and regions. 
            In the United States, for example, the Monarch butterfly is one of the most well-known cases of a butterfly 
            species facing significant threats. While not all species are endangered, many are experiencing declines that 
            could lead to their being threatened in the future.
        
            Specifically, the Monarch butterfly has seen a dramatic decrease in population over the past few decades, attributed
            to the loss of milkweed plants (which serve as the sole food source for Monarch caterpillars) due to agricultural 
            practices and urbanization, as well as changes in climate patterns affecting their migration routes.
            
            Another example is the Miami Blue butterfly, once widespread across coastal areas in southern Florida, which is 
            now considered critically endangered due to habitat destruction and fragmentation.

            The status of butterfly species can be monitored through the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
            Red List, national lists, and research conducted by conservation organizations, providing updated information 
            on which species are at risk and the level of their endangerment.

    <!-- Conservation Efforts -->
    <section id="conservation-efforts">
        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>Our conservation efforts focus on several key areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Habitat Restoration: We support projects aimed at restoring and maintaining habitats that are crucial for 
                butterfly survival, such as milkweed planting for monarch butterflies.</li>
            <li>We believe knowledge is power. Our website provides resources and information on how individuals and 
                communities can contribute to butterfly conservation.</li>
            <li>At-Home Science: Get involved with science projects at home or in school that track butterfly 
                populations and migrations. Your observations can help scientists gather vital data.</li>
            <li>Supporting Legislation: Advocating for policies and legislation that protect butterflies and their 
                habitats is crucial. Its important to stay up to date an informed on how to support any and all 
                conservation efforts.</li>
